# Surfs Up Interpretation
In this module, we present an analysis of data for the island of Oahu over six years of temperature and precipitation on an almost daily basis.  While on the mainland, there are often great variations in temperature and precipitation between June and December, this appears to be less so on the island of Oahu.  Given that the Hawaiian islands are nearer the equator than the mainland US, this is expected.  Some stats are as follows: 
## June Climate
In June over six years of records (n=1574 points for precipitation and n=1700 for temperature, we have:
Average temp. 74.94 degrees and .14 inches of precipitation.
Minimum temp was 64 degrees.
The maximum temperature over this time was 85, and the maximum precipitation was 4.43 inches.
IQR for temp= 77-73 or 4 degrees, IQR for precipitation was .12 inches (0-.12 inches)
## December Climate
In December over six years of records (n=1405 points for precipitation and n=1517 for temperature, we have:
Average temp. 71.04 degrees and .21 inches of precipitation.
Minimum temperature was 56 degrees
The maximum temperature over this time was 83, and the maximum precipitation was 6.42 inches.
IQR for temp= 69-74 or 5 degrees, IQR for precipitation was .12 inches (0-.12 inches)
Other statistics are reported in the Jupyter Notebook entitled Challenge.ipynb

## Recommendations for further analysis
I have four recommendations:
1. Sample randomly some data points from the full data set to get a sense of the overall climactic characteristics of Oahu, not just in June and December.
2. Conduct research using other published material on the Web to look at other business indicators, such as the cost of living, median rents and costs of homes, as well as hotel rates.
3. Gather information on the characteristics of tourists and food or restaurant favorites (could use Yelp)
4. Research other businesses on the island that either specialize in ice cream or supply surfing products and see what their profits are, length of time in business, and if available, data on failure rates of such businesses.

## Conclusions
Based on the data, we can be fairly certain that the climate is generally favorable for the ice cream and surfing business, and that the likelihood of high rainfall or freezing temperatures is low.  We have over six years of data to substantiate the very temperate and pleasant climate of Oahu.
